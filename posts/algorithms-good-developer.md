I've seen it countless times. Brilliant algorithm solvers who struggle in real codebases. LeetCode masters who can't collaborate on a team.

There's a distinction we need to make.

**The Ninjas.** They solve technical puzzles. They optimize for Big O. They thrive in competition. Hand them a problem with clear inputs and outputs, and they'll find the optimal solution.

**The Statesmen.** They prioritize maintainability. They think about the next developer who'll read this code. They align technical decisions with business outcomes. They collaborate, communicate, and compromise.

Real-world development favors the Statesmen.

Because in production, the challenges aren't algorithmic. They're:
- Reading code you didn't write
- Debugging systems you don't fully understand
- Communicating trade-offs to non-technical stakeholders
- Shipping something imperfect today vs. something perfect never

Algorithms matter. Fundamentals matter. But they're table stakes, not the whole game.

The best developers I know aren't the ones who can invert a binary tree on a whiteboard. They're the ones who make everyone around them more effective.

That's a skill no algorithm can teach.
