Open source initiatives thrive when they prioritize user experience. A project's website is its handshake with the world — and poor design undermines adoption before users ever see the code.

Consider GIMP's outdated interface or GitHub repositories with unclear documentation. These friction points push potential contributors away. Contrast that with well-designed platforms like Bootstrap that invite participation through clean, intuitive presentation.

Design isn't just aesthetics. It's communication. It tells users: we care about your experience, not just our code.

The best open source projects understand this. They invest in documentation, onboarding flows, and visual clarity. Because in the end, the most elegant algorithm means nothing if no one can figure out how to use it.
