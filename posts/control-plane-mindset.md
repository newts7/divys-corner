Most developers focus on the immediate task — the feature, the bug fix, the sprint goal. But the best engineers think differently. They adopt what I call the Control Plane Mindset.

Rather than focusing solely on immediate coding tasks, consider the overall architecture and how your code fits into the larger system. This means:

**Anticipating failures.** Not if, but when things break. What happens then? Have you designed for graceful degradation?

**Understanding system-wide interactions.** Your service doesn't exist in isolation. How does it communicate with others? What happens when dependencies fail?

**Collaborating across teams.** Resilient design isn't a solo sport. It requires conversations with infrastructure, security, and platform teams.

The control plane in networking manages how data flows through a system. As developers, we need that same bird's-eye view — understanding not just what our code does, but how it participates in the larger orchestration.

This mindset shift transforms you from a code writer into a systems thinker. And that's where the real engineering happens.
